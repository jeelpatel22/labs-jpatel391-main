hypotenus of a right angle triangle:

$$ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$


geometric series: 

$$ \sum_{i=0}^{n} ar^i $$


arithmetic series closed form: 

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$

Ans1. The hardest part for me in this lab was creating Latex formulas because I was little confused about it before that is why.

Ans2. I think working in codespace is really helpful because we can use it really instantly and can stay in 1 project and it's really helpful. I don't think thaat I would have any problem while working with codespace.
